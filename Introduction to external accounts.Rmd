##  General framework
* Real economy (output, price level, exchange rates)
* Government sector (fiscal revenues and expenditures)
* Monetary and financial sector 
* External sector (BoP and IIP)

** Modeling requires these four sectors to be consistent with one another

## External sector
* Free trade a rare area of consensus among economists
* International trade allows global production to be organized more efficiently: international division of labor
* Breaks the identity that domestic consumption and investment = domestic production
* Spending in excess of domestic production can be financed by accumulating external liabilities
* Excess of production over spending results in accumulation of external wealth

## Balance of payments - some basics
* Records transactions of goods, services, and assets between residents and foreign residents in two separate accounts:
    + Current account
    + Capital and financial account
* Transactions recorded in a major international currency, normally USD
* Complied on accrual accounting basis
* Constructed with double entry accounting system: + is a credit and - a debit.

## BOP - Current account
* Goods - Trade balance = exports - imports of goods
* Services
    + Transporation/travel
    + Government services
    +Other services
* Income
    + Compensation of employees
    + Investment income
* Current transfers

__The CA balance is often short hand for a country's external position__

## BOP Capital account
  * Capital account: 
    + Capital transfers 
    + Acquisition/disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets

* Financial account 
    + Direct investment (FDI), net
    + Portfolio investment, net
    + Other investments, net
    + Loans, trade credits
    + Reserve assets - finance imbalances elsewhere in BOP (important to understand)
    
## Determinants of CAB: savings and investment - absorption approach
* CAB = Gross national disposable income (GNDI) - Absorption (A)
* CA deficit occurs when  a country spends beyond its means or absorbs more than it produces
* Thus, reducing CA deficit requires an increase in income and/or reduction in absorption
* Increasing output (and hence income): in short-term: requires unused capacity; medium-term: increased production capacity through investment, labor force participation, and structural policies
* Reducing absorption achieved by contracting final comsumption or investment

## Determinants of CAB: savings and investment - SI approach
* Savings-investment balance approach
    + CAB = Savings - Investment
* In this view, CAB reflects country's use of foreign savings
* Excess of investment over savings must be covered by foreign saving
* CA deficit thus reduced by increasing savings and/or reducing investment

## Determiants of CAB: capital flows and reserves
* The CAB identities imply:
    + CAB + Net Capital Inflow (FI) - Change in Reserves (delta RES) = 0
* CA deficit can be maintained only as long as capital inflows persist and/or net official international reserves decline
* Large and persistent CA deficits and increasing net international indebtedness raise questions over sustainability
